"""How a pool's waterfall orders its rungs and reacts to a failed attempt.

``maximize_availability`` (the default, historical behavior) fails over to the
next rung on any failover-eligible error. ``maximize_cache`` does NOT fail over on
a throttle (429) -- it returns the throttle so the caller retries the warm rung
after backoff, preserving its prompt cache rather than restarting cold on another
provider -- while STILL failing over on operational deadness
(auth/not-found/5xx/transport) and on a stalled lane (a first-byte or
header-phase timeout that never answered), for which there is no warm cache to
preserve. A genuinely retryable timeout (provider 408) redials the warm rung in
both modes. Client errors reject without failover in both modes.

``maximize_cache_affinity`` keeps availability-style failover (a throttle DOES
fail over: the deterministic alternate builds warm cache instead of the caller
waiting out a backoff) but replaces the certified initial rung order with a
per-request weighted rendezvous hash of the request's stable affinity
fingerprint, so every worker independently sends one conversation to the same
rung and, when that rung sheds or dies, to the same alternate. Rung weights
come from each deployment's authored ``GatewayRungDispatchPolicy``.

Widening this literal is deployment-ordered, like every catalog vocabulary
change: a new value may be AUTHORED only after every serving worker runs a
build that parses it, because an older worker rejects the unknown value at
hydration and fails that alias closed (the per-alias fail-safe excludes the
alias; the worker still serves everything else). The hosted platform is the
only author and its release contract pins this order: engine release, then
fleet-wide pin bump, then the catalog opt-in.

    When a pool authors this policy, a throttle (429 or overload) on a rung
    whose warm cache is worth waiting for is no longer failed over or
    surfaced on its first occurrence: the data plane waits with exponential
    backoff and re-dials the SAME rung, up to ``max_attempts`` redials per
    rung, before the ladder advances to the next certified rung, and a
    throttle surfaces to the caller only once every rung is exhausted. Each
    redial waits ``base_delay_ms * 2**n`` milliseconds (``n`` counting from
    zero, equal-jittered, capped at ``max_delay_ms``), or the provider's own

    ``Retry-After`` above ``max_delay_ms`` means the rung is out for longer
    than the pool is willing to wait, so the ladder advances instead of
    waiting. A wait never exceeds the rung's first-byte allowance or what
    the request deadline leaves for the redial itself.

    Every field defaults to inert so an unauthored rung behaves exactly as

    affinity weight, fresh-session threshold, and sticky binding are read only
    under a pool's ``maximize_cache_affinity`` policy. Weighted fairness is
    always on for every bounded rung, whatever ``fair_share`` says.

    Attributes:
        fair_share: Authored fairness flag, default ``False``; it no longer
            changes admission. Every bounded rung (an authored bound, or the

            bound to its weighted share (``AuthorizationSnapshot.fair_share_weight``),
            work-conserving, with freed capacity reserved for recently active
            under-share organizations. Retained because persisted catalog
            snapshots serialize it and their identity digests read it; removal
            waits for a snapshot cutover. An authored ``True`` still requires

            the paying overflow off on this rung. Never read under the
            worker's default lane bound, whose factors protect the worker.
        priority_overflow_pro: The same for a Pro caller (``priority_admission``
            2). Paying never overflows past Pro: an authored paying above
            Pro is refused, and at runtime the effective paying multiple is
            clamped to the effective Pro one (an authored Pro of ``1.0`` turns
            both off).
        upstream_priority: Send the caller's admission level to this rung as
            the vLLM request ``priority`` body field (Pro 0, paying 1, free 2;
            lower runs first under ``--scheduling-policy priority``). Author it
