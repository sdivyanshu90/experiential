Split from ``requests`` for the module line budget. The strict wire model
owns the real Responses contract; the installed ``openai`` SDK schema is a
cross-check that lags the live surface (echoed ``phase``, ``status``
requirements, null reasoning ``content``, id-less assistant history), so the
probe validates a NORMALIZED copy built here. The two ``require_*`` rules
are contract statements the SDK does not police and the provider does:
text-part spelling per role and a non-empty ``input``.
