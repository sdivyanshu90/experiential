"""Capability-preservation policy for one certified gateway route.

Admission prefers a rung that preserves every caller semantic verbatim; that
preference already exists in three layers (operational deadness skipping in
``native_execution.dispatchable_route_profiles``, per-rung generation-control
narrowing in ``generation_route_compat``, and the per-deployment capability
preflight plus payload build in the control plane's admit loop). This module
owns the step AFTER all three fail: the minimal COERCE-WITH-DISCLOSURE that
keeps a request servable when semantics allow; when they do not, the rung's
own field-scoped rejection stays the answer. A coercion is never silent:
every substitution is disclosed through ``ignored_parameters`` in
``path->effective`` form, logged, and counted by the control plane's
admission metrics.

    Claude Code pins a ``thinking`` config on every model, so the named
    rejection at route shaping would make whole sessions unusable against
    reasoning models the provider itself serves fine through an effort. Once
    every rung has declined the config verbatim (an all-non-Anthropic route
    always does; a mixed route reaches here only when its Anthropic rung
    declined too, for the config or for another control), the config
    translates to the nearest effort the route actually serves, disclosed as
    ``thinking->reasoning_effort:<tier>(<source>)``. The requested tier comes
    from :func:`_requested_thinking_tier`: a budget-less config from the lane's
    catalog default depth (medium
    when no rung pins one). The combined ladder is a union of per-rung
    ladders, so the naive nearest tier may be served only by rungs that reject
    some other control; candidates are therefore tried in nearness order (ties
    prefer the lower tier) and the translation is the closest tier that
    survives full route construction and the caller's admission probe,
    mirroring the explicit-effort snap in :func:`coerce_generation_parameters`.

    An explicit disabled config only translates to an exact off tier; when
    none serves it keeps the typed refusal. Where no active tier serves an
    enabled config, it drops with disclosure: the route's default is stated
    openly, which is the rule every first-party-pinned field follows here (a
    zero-reasoning route drops a pinned effort the same way). A route with no
    reasoning rung discloses ``unsupported_by_route``; a route that reasons
    but cannot state any tier beside this request's other controls discloses
    ``no_servable_tier``. The drop is offered only when the admission probe
    accepts it, so a request whose real blocker is another control keeps that
    rejection. An explicit caller effort is the same channel already stated in
    the route's own vocabulary, so it wins verbatim and the config drops with
    one disclosure. Replayed thinking blocks are signed provider state no

    rejection instead would fail every forced-choice request against a model
    the provider serves fine under ``auto``. Dropping ``service_tier``
