provider serves 200K and long sessions fail). ``interleaved-thinking``

carries opaquely. The remaining four are the same tokens the gateway
injects itself when the bound field (``context_management``,
``diagnostics``, ``speed``, ``thinking.display: "updates"``) is present;
Claude Code sends the display token beside ``display: "updates"``, and
dropping it while the field still dispatched made Anthropic refuse the
request (2026-10-05). Every other caller token is
validated and dropped with an ``anthropic-beta.<token>`` disclosure, never
rejected and never blind-forwarded; notable deliberate drops are
``server-side-fallback-*`` and ``fallback-credit-*`` (an upstream model
swap would falsify this gateway's committed route identity and billing)

the caller copy is neither forwarded (a bare token without its field, or on
