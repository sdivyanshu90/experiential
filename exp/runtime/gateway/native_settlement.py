    control plane files ANY non-null usage as observed (a tool-only usage is
    its convention for a provider that omitted the meter but streamed calls),
    and a tool call is output the meter should have counted, so tool names on
    an all-zero report describe a stream whose meter is not credible; losing
    ``tools_used`` on that row beats filing it as observed.
