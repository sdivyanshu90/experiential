"""Per-line wire shaping for the batch lane: request bodies, results, usage.

Anthropic Message Batches accept only Messages-shaped params, yet the lane
admits Chat Completions and Responses lines on Anthropic rungs. A line's
public body travels to the Anthropic wire, and the provider's Message result
travels back to the surface the caller submitted, through the same decoders,
payload builder, and response assembly the synchronous lane uses, so the
engine stays the single dialect authority. Usage extraction across the three
provider wire shapes lives here too, in the synchronous usage contract.
