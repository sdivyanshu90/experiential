"""The batch engine: submit validation, reservation, polling, and settlement.

One engine instance owns job lifecycle over host-installed seams. Submit is
fail-closed: every line must name a batch-callable model explicitly, one
provider serves the whole job, and every accepted line reserves its estimated
cost before the provider sees anything. Settlement is idempotent per line and
survives process restarts because all state lives behind the host's stores.
