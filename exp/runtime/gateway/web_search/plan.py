"""Decide, run, and inject one gateway web search at admission.

The planner runs after the route is known and before per-rung shaping:

* A route every rung of which serves the caller's spelling natively (an
  all-``openai_responses`` route for a Responses ``web_search`` tool, an
  all-``anthropic_messages`` route for an Anthropic ``web_search_*`` server
  tool) keeps the provider's own search; the gateway does nothing.
* Otherwise, with a configured backend, the gateway searches once for the
  caller's latest user turn, injects the ranked results as one instruction
  turn (the same mechanism as the JSON-object instruction, so token
  reservations already count it), strips the provider-native carriers so
  every rung answers from the same evidence, and reports the search to the
  data plane for citations and the per-search count.
* Without a backend, or when the search fails, the request still serves and
  the drop is disclosed through ``ignored_parameters``.

The injected turn frames the results as untrusted reference data inside a
delimited block; every vendor-supplied field is sanitized (control characters,
delimiter tokens, whitespace, length) so a page cannot smuggle instructions or
close the block early. The model is told never to follow anything inside it.
