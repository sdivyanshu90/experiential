"""Estimate the meter of a dispatched attempt whose caller left before the provider's final usage.

Most OpenAI-shaped wires report token usage only in the stream's final frame.
When the caller disconnects first, the data plane closes the upstream and the
provider still bills the prompt it processed and the tokens it generated up to
the cut, so settling that attempt as unknown leaves real provider spend
uncharged. The gateway already tokenizes every prompt for its reservation and
already saw every generated delta, so it can price the work with its own
tokenizer: observed legs win, estimated legs fill the holes, and the result is
labelled ``estimated`` (never ``observed``) wherever it lands.
