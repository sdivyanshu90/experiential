"""Per-rung dispatch construction for the native bridge.

Admission hands the bridge an ordered route; this module turns one rung of
it into everything the data plane needs for that deployment: the frozen wire
entry, the dispatch signer, the frozen-body binding and the reasoning-carrier
authority. Rungs are shaped independently so a control (``parallel_tool_calls``
today) can be honored natively on one rung and emulated on the next without
the route-level request changing.

A rung the host flagged in ``snapshot.zdr_constrained_deployment_ids`` is
frozen with OpenRouter's zero-data-retention routing constraint on its payload
and the metadata opt-in header on its dispatch; a flagged rung on any other
wire fails closed here, never dispatching unconstrained.

A rung whose authored dispatch policy sets ``upstream_priority`` (a self-hosted
vLLM lane) carries the caller's admission level as vLLM's ``priority`` field.
