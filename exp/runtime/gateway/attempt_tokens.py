"""Realistic worst-case token estimation for one physical gateway attempt.

The planning ``(input, output)`` token bound a single dispatch can consume, per
API surface. It is what :func:`exp.runtime.gateway.budgets.maximum_attempt_cost_nano_usd`
prices, and what the platform's free-tier and token-rate-limit windows reserve
in flight (released to the settled truth on finish). The input half counts the
prompt the provider actually reads with a real BPE tokenizer and adds explicit
headroom; it is an estimate with documented margins, not an upper bound, and
settlement always replaces it with the provider's exact usage. Lives in its
own module so ``budgets`` stays under the repo's hand-authored line ceiling.
