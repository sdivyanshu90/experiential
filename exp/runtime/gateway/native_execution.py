"""Waterfall policy, wire building, and in-flight state for the native data plane.

The native (Rust) engine executes the certified deployment waterfall itself,
but every policy decision stays here: the ordered wire route is resolved and
built per deployment at admission, each physical dispatch is reserved through
``start_attempt`` immediately before network work, and candidate selection
enforces the frozen waterfall semantics (attempt caps, per-failure retry and
failover eligibility, deployment health circuits with bounded last-resort and
forced claims, and per-deployment budget skipping). The bridge module owns the
boundary encoding; this module owns the frozen semantics.

    The hard total cap ends the ladder, a retryable failure redials the same
    deployment while its bounded count and a health claim allow, and otherwise
    a failover-eligible failure (or an opted-in typed refusal) advances to the
    next claimable deployment.

    A pool authoring ``throttle_redial`` turns a throttle into a bounded
    backoff-and-redial on the warm rung first: when the data plane reports it
    has waited the schedule (``throttle_backoff``), the same rung is claimed
    through its own throttle window while the per-rung redial cap and the
    total cap allow. With a schedule authored a throttle never surfaces
    mid-ladder; once the redials are spent (or the data plane declined to
    wait, because the wait would not fit the deadline or the rung was not
    worth it) the throttle advances like any failover-eligible failure, and
    the caller sees a 429 only when the whole ladder is exhausted.

    A throttle (429) is the one failure whose failover is a cache-stakes
    decision. When the pool authors ``throttle_cache_threshold`` it is the
    authoritative throttle control under every ``failover_mode``: the throttle
    surfaces to the caller (who retries the warm rung after the provider's
    backoff, keeping its prompt cache) exactly when ``cached_fraction``, the
    requesting organization's observed cached-token fraction on the throttled
    rung, is at or above the threshold, and fails over cold otherwise. A
    threshold of ``0.0`` therefore always surfaces, and an organization with
    no cache evidence on the rung (fraction 0) always fails over: a request is
    never stranded to protect cache that does not exist. Without a threshold
    the mode's fixed rule applies: ``maximize_cache`` surfaces every throttle,
    while ``maximize_cache_affinity`` deliberately does NOT share that
    short-circuit (its cache story is the deterministic rendezvous alternate)
    and fails over exactly like ``maximize_availability``. In both shapes a
    same-request redial of the throttled rung is impossible, because the 429
    sets the rung's throttle window before the next candidate is chosen, so
    surfacing is the only cache-preserving move.

    Timeouts are identical in every mode: a retryable 408 redials the warm
    rung via its own ``retryable_same_deployment`` flag, while a
    first-byte/header-phase stall is a dead lane the classifier marks
    non-redialable and so still fails over. Operational deadness (auth,
    not-found, provider 5xx, transport) and client errors are identical in
    every mode too: deadness always fails over, client errors never do.

    Args:
        health: Revision-isolated circuit and throttle registry.
        keys: One health key per ordered route deployment.
        failure: The classified failure that ended the previous dispatch.

        cached_fraction: The requesting organization's observed cached-token
            fraction on the rung at ``current_depth`` (0 without evidence);
            read only against an authored threshold.
        throttle_redial: The pool's authored backoff-and-redial schedule, or
            ``None`` to keep throttles failover-only.
        throttle_backoff: Whether the data plane waited the schedule's
            backoff and asks to redial the throttled rung.
        throttle_redial_budget: Post-backoff redials this request may still
            make on the rung at ``current_depth`` (its admission-time budget
            less the redials already reserved there); the budget counts only
            post-backoff redials, so an earlier retryable-class redial there
            never spends it.
        maximum_total_attempts: Hard cap across retries and deployments.
        maximum_same_deployment_attempts: Initial dispatch plus safe retries
