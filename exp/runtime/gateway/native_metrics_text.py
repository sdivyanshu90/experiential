"""Prometheus text rendering of the content-free gateway metrics snapshot.

The native data plane serves ``GET /metrics.json`` from the composed snapshot
built by ``NativeControlPlane.metrics_snapshot``. This module renders that
same snapshot in the Prometheus text exposition format (version 0.0.4) so the
``GET /metrics`` route can feed a standard scraper without a sidecar. The
rendering is a pure function of the snapshot: every family is a fixed name
with bounded enum labels, so the exposition stays content-free on the same
terms as the JSON body (no alias, key, model, prompt, or org identifier).
