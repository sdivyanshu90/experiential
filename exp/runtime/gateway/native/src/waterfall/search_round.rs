//! One gateway-run tool-search round between two dials of the same rung.
//!
//! The dial that ended with only withheld search calls is settled as a
//! completed, billed attempt of its own (non-finalizing: the request stays
//! open for the re-dial); the control plane then runs the search over the
//! deferred catalog, extends the conversation with the call and its result,
//! loads the matched tools, and answers with the rebuilt wire for the same
//! depth. A control plane that cannot answer fails the request closed with
//! the gateway's own error: a half answer is never served.
