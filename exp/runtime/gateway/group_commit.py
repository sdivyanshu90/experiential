"""Group-commit write-behind ledger batching durable writes on one writer thread.

Concurrent request-path ledger writes are funneled through a single dedicated
writer thread that drains queued operations into one SQLite transaction per
batch. Every caller awaits its own operation's durable commit before
proceeding, so acceptance, budget reservation, and terminal settlement keep
their exact fail-closed semantics while the per-request fsync cost is
amortized across all operations sharing a batch. There is no flush window:
no caller observes success before its write is durable on disk.

Two callers share the one queue and writer thread: the asyncio engine awaits
:class:`GroupCommitAttemptLedger`, while threads without an event loop (the
native data plane's worker threads) block on :class:`SyncGroupCommitLedger`.
Operations from both interleave in the same batches, so the two gateway
engines amortize their fsyncs together.
