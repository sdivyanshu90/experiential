"""Embeddings admission for the native data plane.

The embeddings surface reuses the chat surface's authority, ledger, route
resolution, deployment-health, and reservation seams unchanged, and differs
only in what it admits: a message-less, non-streaming request that dispatches
one buffered OpenAI-wire ``/embeddings`` POST per attempt. This module holds
that admission so the already line-budgeted ``native_bridge`` carries only the
boundary method.

Deliberately absent on day one (each is a documented follow-up, not an
oversight): keyed replay (an inbound ``Idempotency-Key`` is ignored, never
keyed), input guardrails (the guardrail engine reads chat messages), project
targets (learned selection embeds the chat prompt), and body-signing dialects
(Bedrock has no OpenAI embeddings wire).
