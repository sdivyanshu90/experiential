"""Streaming capabilities for deterministic redactors.

A deterministic redactor decides about a prefix of a completion without
seeing the rest of it, so a streamed completion does not have to be buffered
before the caller receives its first byte. This module owns the release rule
that makes that safe: the adapter names how much of the buffered tail is
still undecided, everything before that point is redacted and released, and
the tail stays buffered until more text arrives or the stream ends.

The native data plane owns withheld events. Deterministic release helpers are
pure; model-backed output classifiers require the complete completion.
