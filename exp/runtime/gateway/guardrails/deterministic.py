"""Resolve deterministic guardrail chains for in-plane native enforcement.

A deterministic adapter (today the local ``regex`` rule) has an exact native
implementation in the Rust data plane, so a chain built only from such
adapters can run beside the buffered completion with no Python callback, no
GIL acquisition, and no JSON round trip of the completion text. Every other
adapter, including ``http_json`` and future model-based classifiers, keeps
crossing the existing Python boundary unchanged.

Nothing here logs request text, completions, detector payloads, or
replacements.
