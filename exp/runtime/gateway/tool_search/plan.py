"""Decide at admission whether the gateway runs tool search, and shape the dispatch.

* A route every rung of which serves the caller's spelling natively (an
  all-``anthropic_messages`` route for an Anthropic ``tool_search_tool_*``
  declaration, an all-``openai_responses`` route for a Responses
  ``tool_search`` tool) keeps the provider's own search; deferred tools and
  the declaration forward verbatim as today.
* Otherwise the gateway partitions the caller's tools: those without
  ``defer_loading`` load immediately, the rest form the searchable corpus,
  and the model receives one gateway-owned ``tool_search`` function tool.
  The provider-native declarations are stripped so no wire sees a shape it
  cannot serve. The corpus and the rebuild material live on the in-flight
  request; the data plane withholds the model's search calls and asks for a
  rebuilt dispatch per round (:mod:`exp.runtime.gateway.tool_search.round`).
* A declaration with no deferred tools has nothing to search: the carriers
  are stripped and the drop is disclosed.
